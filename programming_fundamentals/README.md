## Course Objectives

This course was a prerequisite for my Master Studies in Data Science.
The following competencies were acquired:

1. Write programs with Java that use basic constructs such as conditional statements and loops
2. Explain the basics of object-oriented programming and write classes
3. Solve problems using recursion 
4. Describe the following data structures and their related operations: lists, stacks, queue, and binary trees
5. Write programs using a variety of data structures, including lists, stacks, and queues
6. Analyze the correctness and running time of programs which use data structures 
7. Describe common algorithms for  sorting and searching
8. Use asymptotic analysis of upper and average complexity bounds
9. Identify differences among best, average, and worst case behaviors

## Course Objectives

•	Apply the tools of calculus, linear algebra, optimization, probability and statistics to identify likely characteristics and trends buried in large data sets so that reasonable conclusions about the data may be drawn.

•	Write software that implements the mathematical techniques required to extract meaning from large data sets, primarily using off-the-shelf mathematical software tools.

•	Apply clustering algorithms to characterize large data sets in terms of subsets with similar properties.

•	Create and choose visualization approaches that clearly depict the characteristics of the data that need to be communicated for a particular purpose.

•	Choose appropriate data science techniques for solving problems in disciplines that produce accurate, timely insights from large quantities of data.

•	Synthesize theoretical and research concepts from multiple perspectives to inform inquiry and practice.

•	Formulate creative responses to complex issues through critical analysis.
